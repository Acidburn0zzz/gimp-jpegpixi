A GIMP plug-in to use GIMP as a GUI for jpegpixi.

jpegpixi is a program to interpolate pixels in JFIF (JPEG) image files,
only changing the relevant DCT blocks.

This plug-in for GIMP allows choosing:
* the area (using a rectangular selection);
* method;
* how to generate the result's file name.

When you run the plug-in after making a selection, it opens an options
window where you can choose the above.

The main operation of the plug-in consists in running jpegpixi on the
image currently loaded in GIMP, and opening the resulting file in a new
window.

Whether or not there is a selection, if the grid is not 8x8, the
plug-in will change it to 8x8, so that you can choose between
pixelizing more pixels and touching fewer blocks.
