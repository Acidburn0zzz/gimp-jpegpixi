A GIMP plug-in to use GIMP as a GUI for jpegpixi.

jpegpixi is a program to interpolate pixels in JFIF (JPEG) image files,
only changing the relevant DCT blocks.

This plug-in for GIMP allows choosing:
* the area (using a rectangular selection);
* method;
* how to generate the result's file name.

When you run the plug-in after making a selection, it opens an options
window where you can choose the above.

The main operation of the plug-in consists in running jpegpixi on the
image currently loaded in GIMP, and opening the resulting file in a new
window.

There is a quirk concerning grid settings: if the grid is not 8x8, the
plug-in will change it to 8x8 and abort, needing to be started again.
This is intentional (maybe you forgot the need for the grid and started
selecting), but can be changed if not worth it.
